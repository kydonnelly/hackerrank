Right now most are in C, some are in Python 2.7.6.

It should go without saying that these are not intended to be solutions for you to use and submit; that defeats the entire purpose of practicing programming. As far as I know there are no prizes or anything for this site so it'd just be time wasted copying/pasting.

The solutions pass all test cases unless specified otherwise (comment "not solved yet"). If you want to find all such files make sure to do a case-insensitive grep.

I have a few helper files for C in Utilities. When submitting files that use a utility, I have just been replacing the includes with their associated implementations.

I have more solved than are on here but I only move over the old ones that are remotely readable :)

If you're going to open it in XCode, I'm using Version 5.1 (5B130a) on OS X 10.10.1 (Yosemite)
