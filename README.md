https://www.hackerrank.com solutions. Not sure if any/all of these problems are still up there. 

Right now most are in C, some are in Python 2.7.6.

The solutions pass all test cases unless specified otherwise (comment "not solved yet").

I have a few helper files for C in Utilities. When submitting files that use a utility, I have just been replacing the includes with their implementations.

Make sure that if you want to run one of the C solutions, need to change the function whose name matches the filename to be main.

If opening in XCode, I was using Version 5.1 (5B130a) on OS X 10.10.1 (Yosemite)
